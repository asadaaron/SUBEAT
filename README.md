#  Autopsy Data Collection Guideline

##  Requirements (Software needed):
1.  Autopsy:  [to read and analyze the data from Android and iPhone devices] https://www.autopsy.com/download/
2.  Finder App: For iPhone backup creation
3. Windows File Explorer: For Android backup creation

##  Data collection process:
###  1.	Prepare the Device:
Ensure the Android or iPhone device you want to collect data from is fully charged and connected to a computer with a USB cable.
###  2.	Create Disk Image (Android):
Launch the Free ISO Creator software.
Follow the software's instructions to create a disk image (ISO) of the Android device. This image will preserve the data on the device for analysis.
###  3.	Create iPhone Backup:
The macOS 10.15 (or later) is necessary to back up the iPhone using the Finder app. It is also possible to back up the iPhone using the iTunes app
with the previous versions of macOS and Windows operating systems.
###  4.	Extract Data (iPhone):
For iPhone devices, you'll need to add the iPhone data extraction plugin to Autopsy. Use the following GitHub link for the plugin: https://github.com/ernestbies/iOSDeviceDataExtractor
Follow the instructions provided in the plugin's repository to integrate it into your Autopsy installation.
###  5.	Import Disk Image (Android) and iPhone Data:
Launch Autopsy on your computer.
Create a new case by selecting "New Case" and providing relevant details.
Add the disk image (ISO) created from the Android device and the data extracted from the iPhone device to the case.
###  6.	Data Analysis and Examination:
Autopsy will process the data and present it in a user-friendly interface.
Use Autopsy's built-in tools to analyze the data from both devices. You can explore call logs, text messages, photos, videos, app usage, internet browsing history, and more. It generates autopsy.db and corresponding database files for each domain for iPhone.
###  7.	Viewing Data in DB SQLite (Optional):
If you need more detailed examination of specific data, use DB SQLite to view the data saved as a DB file.

###  8.	Usages of Datex App:
1. Select the Operating System (Android/iPhone).
2. Assign a user identification in username e.g. user_xyz
3. Select the source file location

iPhone:
Copy the autopsy.db and corresponding database files generated by the autopsy in a directory. From the Datex select the directory that contains the database files corresponding to the domains. Also, select the directory that contains the autopsy.db files. Select the output directory from the Datex App interface where the output of the Datex App will be generated. 

Android:
Copy the Autopsy and Backup and Restore - APP & SMS generated Excel files in a directory. From the Datex App interface, select the directory that contains the files. Select the output directory from the Datex App interface where the output of the Datex App will be generated.
